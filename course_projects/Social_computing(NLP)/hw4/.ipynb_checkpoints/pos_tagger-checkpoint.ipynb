    "# Twitter POS Tagging \n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to introduce a a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger developed for tweets which was released as part of the [TweetNLP](https://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP/) toolkit. The code is written in Java and the python wrapper for the tokenization is from [this](https://github.com/myleott/ark-twokenize-py) github repository. This tutorial has code from the [TweetNLP](https://github.com/brendano/ark-tweet-nlp/) github repository as well as the python wrapper from [this](https://github.com/ianozsvald/ark-tweet-nlp-python) repository."

    "- POS tagging involves identifying part-of-speech of tokens in a given text. This can be viewed as a task of labeling the sentence w_1, w_2, ....., w_n with pos tags, one for each word: t_1, t_2, ...., t_n.\n",
    "- The 8 common parts of speech for english language are:\n",
    "  1. Noun\n",
    "  2. Verb\n",
    "  3. Pronoun\n",
    "  4. Preposition\n",
    "  5. Adverb\n",
    "  6. Conjuction\n",
    "  7. Participle\n",
    "  8. Article  \n",
    "- Twitter data is different from standard language data in that there are tokens such as #, @, emoticons, URLs, etc. So the tagset for twitter needs to incorporate the tags for these new tokens. The tags that are used to annotate tweets are as follows:\n",

    "## Part-of-Speech Tagging for Twitter: Annotation, Features, and Experiments\n",
    "- This tutorial covers how to accomplish the task of POS tagging for twitter data based on this paper: https://aclanthology.org/P11-2008.pdf\n",
    "- The nature of twitter data poses challenges in using standard POS taggers. The paper develops the above tagset for twitter to include tags for words that are not commonly encountered in language outside of twitter. \n",
    "- Around 1,800 tweets were manually annotated with corresponding pos tags.\n",
    "- Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) were used with features specific to twitter POS tagging. The features for the CRF are below (see paper for more details):\n",
    "  - Twitter orthography - these features are rules that detect @, #, and URls.\n",
    "  - Names - these features check for names from a dictionary of compiled tokens which are frequently capitalized.\n",
    "  - Traditional Tag Dictionary - these are features for all tags that occur in PTB.\n",
    "  - Distributional Similarity - these features are constructed from the successor and predecessor probabilities for the 10,000 most common terms.\n",
    "  - Phonetic normalization - words are normalized to ignore alternate spellings of words using the Metaphone algorithm; e.x.{thangs, thanks, thanksss, thanx, thinks, thnx} are mapped to 0NKS.\n",
    "- 1827 tweets that are annotated are divided into training set of 1000 tweets, dev set of 327 tweets, and test set of 500 tweets. The results of the tagger incorporating the above features are compared with the standard Stanford Tagger and using the above feature set for twitter data reduces error by about 25%."
